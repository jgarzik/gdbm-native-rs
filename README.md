# gdbm-native

Rust crate library for reading/writing GDBM key/value databases

## Goals

* Read and Write GDBM databases
* Written in safe, native Rust (no FFI).
* Better-than-C:  Support all 32-/64-bit and big/little endian variants
  without recompiling.
* Tuned for modern machines with solid state storage

## Status

Alpha:  Read-only access works well.  Do not use in production.

## Documentation

The best documentation is the original GDBM source code from the GNU
project: https://www.gnu.org.ua/software/gdbm/

A sister project also provides [additional technical
documentation](https://github.com/jgarzik/gdbm-docs), including file
format information.
